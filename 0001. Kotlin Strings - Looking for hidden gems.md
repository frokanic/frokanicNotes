# Kotlin Strings - Looking for hidden gems

## Introduction

For today's study session, I decided to go with a video from the JetBrains' 
channel, specifically the one below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4WBip822A8&t=121s

Here, I'll go through Sebastian's thoughts and examples, and play around with them 
myself.

## The topics

### Multiline strings and `.trimIndent()`

Multiline strings can be used when our text contains multiple lines, or special characters.
```kotlin
val name = """
    Joe,
    The Great,
    The "Knowledgeable"
""".trimIndent()

println("Hello, $name")
```

When creating a multiline string in Kotlin, the ide automatically adds the
`.trimIndent()` function. This function removes the common indent of all input lines. An 
example of that can be seen below.

```kotlin
val myJson = """
    {
        "name": "jane",
        "lastname": "doe",
        "age": 29
    }
""".trimIndent()

val myUntrimmedJson = """
    {
        "name": "jane",
        "lastname": "doe",
        "age": 29
    }
"""

val myJsonNoIndent = """
    {
        "name": "jane",
        "lastname": "doe",
        "age": 29
    }
""".trimIndent()

println(myJson)
println("----------------------------------------")
println(myUntrimmedJson)
println("----------------------------------------")
println(myJsonNoIndent)
```

The above prints
```
{
    "name": "jane",
    "lastname": "doe",
    "age": 29
}
----------------------------------------
        {
            "name": "jane",
            "lastname": "doe",
            "age": 29
        }
----------------------------------------    
{
            "name": "jane",
            "lastname": "doe",
            "age": 29
        }
```

As we can see both in our example, as well as in the function's documentation, `.trimIndent()`
detects a common minimal indent of all the input lines and removes it from every line.

Additionally, it removes the first and last lines if they are blank. This means that, 
although we may still see empty space, there is no blank text there, so no spaces.

```
""      // empty (length is 0)
"   "   // blank (contains spaces)
"\t"    // blank (contains a tab)
```

In case if there are non-blank lines with no leading whitespace characters (no indent at all)
then the common indent is 0, and therefore this function doesn't change the indentation.

```kotlin
val myJson2 = """
{
            "name": "jane",
            "lastname": "doe",
            "age": 29
        }
    """.trimIndent()

println(myJson2)
```

The above prints

```
{
            "name": "jane",
            "lastname": "doe",
            "age": 29
        }
```

The lines in the original string can be separated with \r\n (CRLF), \n (LF), 
or \r (CR) characters, however, the lines in the resulting string will be separated solely 
with \n (LF) character.

Now let's look how `.trimIndent()` works under the hood.

1. The `.trimIndent()` is an extension function that calls `.replaceIndent("")`, with an
empty string as an argument.

```kotlin
@kotlin.internal.IntrinsicConstEvaluation
public fun String.trimIndent(): String = replaceIndent("")
```

2. `.replaceIndent("")` starts by calling the `lines()` function, that break the string into
lines and returns a list that contains them. It stores the result in a `lines` variable

```kotlin
public fun CharSequence.lines(): List<String> = lineSequence().toList()

public fun CharSequence.lineSequence(): Sequence<String> = splitToSequence("\r\n", "\n", "\r")
```

3. Then, using that `lines` variable, we find the minimum common indent, by 
    1. Dropping the blank items.
    2. Measuring each line's indent and "putting them into a list"
    3. Finding the minimum of those, with a default value of 0

```kotlin
val minCommonIndent = lines
    .filter(String::isNotBlank)
    .map(String::indentWidth)
    .minOrNull() ?: 0
```

4. To put it all together, we return to the user the result of the `reindent(...)` function.
In this function we pass 3 arguments:
   1. A hint for the internal string builder, to which we give the length of the original string
   2. A lambda that dictates how we add indent for each item of our `lines` list, which in our 
case does nothing.
   3. A lambda that dictates how we cut indent for each item of our `lines` list

```kotlin
public fun String.replaceIndent(newIndent: String = ""): String {
    val lines = lines()

    val minCommonIndent = lines
        .filter(String::isNotBlank)
        .map(String::indentWidth)
        .minOrNull() ?: 0

    return lines.reindent(
        length + newIndent.length * lines.size, 
        getIndentFunction(newIndent), 
        { line -> line.drop(minCommonIndent) }
    )
}
```

And like that, the common indention gets removed.


### Handling empty and black strings

Another nice functionality that the Kotlin standard library provides us with is handling
for blank or empty string. This can be detecting them, or handling them, in case they are
empty or blank.

```kotlin
val emptyText = ""
val blankText = " "
val nonEmptyOrBlankText = "This is a text"

println("The emptyText is empty: ${emptyText.isEmpty()}") // prints true
println("The emptyText is blank: ${emptyText.isBlank()}") // prints true, cause empty is blank, but blank is not empty.
println("The blankText is empty: ${blankText.isEmpty()}") // prints false
println("The nonEmptyOrBlankText is empty: ${nonEmptyOrBlankText.isEmpty()}") // prints false

val neverBlankString = " ".ifBlank { 
    "Never blank."
}

println(neverBlankString) // prints "Never blank."
```


### Comparing strings

There are many ways in which strings can be compared in Kotlin.

For starters, we can obviously check their content, by using the double equals operator.

```kotlin
val stringA = "A string"
val stringB = "A string"

if (stringA == stringB) println("Yeah!")
```

Strings can also be compared based on their alphabetical order, as seen below:

```kotlin
println("a" < "b") // prints true

// prints false, since the comparison happens based on the ascii table, 
// where capital letters come before lowercase ones in the latin alphabet
println("A" > "a") 
```

Also, comparison can happen in a non-case-sensitive fashion, as seen below

```kotlin
val name = "foTIs"
println(name.equals(other = "fotis", ignoreCase = true)) // prints true
```

### Splitting strings

Strings may contain a plethora of information, in which case we need to split them up.
This happens with the split function. We can also pass a limit to it as an argument, to 
limit the number of cuts we'll make to the string.

```kotlin
val input = "A;N;S;F;E;A;H;A"
println(input.split(";")) // prints [A, N, S, F, E, A, H, A]
println(input.split(";", limit = 4)) // prints [A, N, S, F;E;A;H;A]
```

Multiline strings can also be split into lines with, as seen above, the lines function

```kotlin
val input = """
    Well this is
    a multiline
    string.
    Should we split it maybe?
""".trimIndent()

// prints [Well this is, a multiline, string., Should we split it maybe?]
println(input.lines())
```


## Final thoughts

Going through the source code and understanding in depth was always both challenging for me,
cause I have a hard time deciding how deep I'll go, as well as exciting. 

The study session was pretty fun, cause I had the chance to take some time to further 
explore some of Kotlin's basic functionality, that we usually pass, to favor topics such
as coroutines.

Thanks for reading :)
