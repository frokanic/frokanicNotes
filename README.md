## Welcome to frokanicNotes

Hi everyone. My name is Fotis, and I've been a professional android developer for 3 years.

I always enjoyed spending some time per day, after work, usually something around 
1 hour, learning something new. Being a second year cs student at the moment though, this 
time, as well as much more, is consumed by my undergrad studies.

And as glad as I may be, for the opportunity to pursue a degree on the field, it does take time away
from what I enjoy studying most; coding.

As a way around that, I created a big list of resources, with various different android and Kotlin 
related topics. Whenever I have free time I will pick a topic of those, and studying it either from the 
resource itself, or from going around the internet, I will explore it, as much and as deep as my time 
and energy allow.

This repo will contain notes from this learning process.
